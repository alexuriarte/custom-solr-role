Scalr Solr Tutorial
===================

This tutorial deploys Solr on infrastructure managed by [Scalr][0]. Follow instructions on the [Scalr Wiki][1].

The test data is a list of Cities, and can be searched using Solr once it is
deployed.

----

Note that the support files are available on Github, but retrieved via S3 as
Github does not allow retrieving large blobs.

They are found at the following locations:

    SOLR_CONFIG_RESOURCE
